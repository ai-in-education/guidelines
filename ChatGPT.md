# ChatGPT

OpenAI defines ChatGPT as "We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT, which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response."

## General Use

* Interesting thread [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/alliekmiller/status/1602745470584967170) listing ways of using ChatGPT:
  * ✅ **Summary**: Copy and paste an article, and ask, “can you summarize this article in one paragraph in a way that a 5th grader could understand it?” 
  * ✅ **Coding**: Ask it to write basic scripts or even more qualitative questions like “what is the most efficient way to loop through a list in Python?”\
  * ✅ **Planning**: Think of an task you have and a reasonable timeline. Ask, “create a schedule for me to launch my new startup by May 1, 2023? Include deliverables, timelines, contingency planning, team bonding, breaks, brainstorming, and user testing.”
  * ✅ **Creativity**: Think of something you want to shake up and ask, “I’m turning 40yo soon and want to celebrate my birthday in a way that incorporates my passions. I love BBQ and axe throwing. What are 3 ideas for a party that costs under $2k?”
  * ✅ **Writer’s Block**: Do you have an email or blog post you’ve been meaning to write? Ask, “write a nice email to Tom - ask him if he enjoyed the offsite, then ask him to update his monthly report.” Use that as a foundation, then edit or tweak as needed.
  * ✅ **Motivation**: AI is not a replacement for trained medical professionals, but if you’re feeling a little low you can ask, “can you give me three motivational phrases to help me get through a hard day when I’m low on sleep?"

# How to use ChatGPT in your assessments

The biggest boon of ChatGPT is its capability to generate comprehensive answers to complex questions. The bane is that those answers are often incorrect, such as including bugs in the computer code or stating false answers (TODO: Examples). As a result, the overall goal would be to include ChatGPT in the education with helping to answer some questions, while maintaining tha bility to critically think about the answers.

## ChatGPT in all Sciences

1. Ask GPT to generate answer to a question and ask students to fact check and mark the answer.
2. Generate Multiple Choice questions for your quizzes
3. ...

## ChatGPT in Programming

1. Tell students to write a computer code. Then, tell them to use ChatGPT to generate the answer. Have them compare the results and analyse performance.
2. Tell students to use ChatGPT to write a computer code, have them analyse the performance and propose improvements or slow downs.
3. ...
